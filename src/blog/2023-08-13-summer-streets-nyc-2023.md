title: Summer Streets NYC 2023
description: >-
  My second adventure. Although it took place in the heart of the city, that
  being Manhattan, it was a great opportunity to exercise and to view the city
  from a different angle. An angle where every New Yorker came together to enjoy
  what the greatest city in the world has to offer. That being a time to spend
  with friends and family and taking in the marvels of infrastructure and nature
  without stressing over a deadline or a chore.

During the last month of summer on the first three Saturdays of the month, New York City hosts Summer Streets. It is worth noting that Summer Streets also take place in July in the boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx, however the longest trail is the one in Manhattan. 

This is my second time partipating in Summer Streets as I have participated in it last year and I must say things have changed. The route remained mostly the same as most of it was made up of Park Ave, however last years route was slightly shorter than this years. A longer route this year of course does not bother me, as it was an opportunity to see and explore more parts of the city that I haven't been to before, so overall this was a change for the better.

If you would like to see how different the routes were in the past two years, click the links below to check them out:
