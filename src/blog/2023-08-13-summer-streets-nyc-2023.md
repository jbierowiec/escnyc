title: Summer Streets NYC 2023
description: >-
  My second adventure. Although it took place in the heart of the city, that
  being Manhattan, it was a great opportunity to exercise and to view the city
  from a different angle. An angle where every New Yorker came together to enjoy
  what the greatest city in the world has to offer. That being a time to spend
  with friends and family and taking in the marvels of infrastructure and nature
  without stressing over a deadline or a chore.

During the last month of summer on the first three Saturdays of the month, New York City hosts Summer Streets. It is worth noting that Summer Streets also take place in July in the boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx, however the longest trail is the one in Manhattan. 

This is my second time partipating in Summer Streets as I have participated in it last year and I must say things have changed. The route remained mostly the same as most of it was made up of Park Ave, however last years route was slightly shorter than this years. A longer route this year of course does not bother me, as it was an opportunity to see and explore more parts of the city that I haven't been to before, so overall this was a change for the better.

If you would like to see how different the routes were in the past two years, click the links below to check them out:

Most summers, people move away from their hometowns or cities and go either to another country for a brief period of time or go to a different region in the United States. For those who stay home or close to home over the summer because of work, often don't get that same enjoyment of a long vacation as others do with a plane ticket or driving across the states. It is often difficult to find anything to do relating to a feeling of a getaway from the city. Summer Streets however offer that opportunity for those working from Monday to Friday in the summer. Although the time of 7:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M. may seem a bit too early for the late sleepers of the city, for those willing to get up early and experience a relaxing moment taking in the city for its beauty, and not its daunting work, it is an experience to remember. 

During work, I was looking forward to the upcoming weekend to take part in the event. When the the sun set that Friday evening, on my way home, I set my timer in the moring to 8:00 with the intention of starting at 9:00. Once at home, I did what I needed to do left to end the day and hit the bed as early as possible. The alarm woke me up and I started to get ready for the trip. Once ready, I made my way towards midtown crossing the Queensboro Bridge and in three and a half blocks I reached Park Ave.
