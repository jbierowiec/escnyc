title: Astoria Park to Rockaway Beach
description: >-
  The first of my adventures. Although it took place within the city, the goal
  still remained the same, to take part in a trip that would make you feel that
  you are outside of the stresses of city life.

This trip came about rather spontaneously. My good friend from high school texted me that he got a new bike and wanted to try out something new. A trip from the top of Queens to the bottom of Queens, that being from Astoria Park to Rockaway Beach. Previous to that message I had no plans other than work, so to see my friend offer such a proposal, was a blessing. 

Due to the idea's unplanned nature, and short notice to when we would do it, I decided to look at the route we would take and to plan using Google's My Maps. The route is relatively straightforward. We would start at the corner of Hoyt Ave S and 21st Street at the tip of Astoria Park, make our way down towards Vernon Boulevard to go along the East River, and once we would hit the Queensboro Bridge in Long Island City, we would make our way up along Queens Plaza and continue onto Queens Boulevard until we would reach the Queens Center Mall in Elmhurst. Once we would get to that point, we would have completed about a third of the trail. We would then make a 90 degree turn onto Woodhaven Boulevard. We would travel all the way down Woodhaven Boulevard until we would reach Ozone Park, where we would then continue down Cross Bay Boulevard and crossing the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge reaching our final destination of Rockaway Beach. 

According to planned out map, this route is 18 miles (\~29 km) long, with an estimated time of travel to be 1 hour and 38 minutes. Mind you, this is in one direction, so for the total trail, we would complete 36 miles (\~58 km) in an ideal time of 3 hours and 16 minutes. 

This was the plan I looked into for the trip. For the full layout of specifics regarding the route, time and mileage, check out the image below:
